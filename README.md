# Melodrama Scripts

This package includes scripts to simplify the creation of presentation with [Spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle). Rather than using this package directly install [melodrama](https://github.com/sebald/melodrama). It will setup everything for you!

## Development

- `npm test` will run the test suite (adding `-- --watch` will activate the watch mode)
- `npm dev:start` will run the `start` script with the *example* folder as entry point.
- `npm dev:init` will run the `init` script and output it to the *.tmp* folder.
